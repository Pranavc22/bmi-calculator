## Concepts Learned
This project has taught me a few new concepts: 
- Using the Theme widget across the app and for specific widgets.
- Refactoring code to have a proper architecture and meaning. 
- Creating custom widgets.
- Working with new widgets like Gesture Detector and Slider
- Multi-page navigation. 

Apart from this, I also learned the importance of consistency in design and more healthy UI and UX practices.
